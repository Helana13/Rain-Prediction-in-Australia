# Rain Prediction in Australia using Logistic Regression
In this project, I implemented a predictive model on Weather dataset of Australia to predict whether or not it will rain tomorrow in Australia. I collected the dataset from Kaggle. I explore the data with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn. make predictions with scikit-learn and eveluated using Logistic Regression.
